# Special Project on Application Acceleration with High-Level Synthesis

This repository was created for the course **Application Acceleration with High-Level Synthesis**, offered by NTU in the Fall 2024 semester. The course is taught by **Professor Jiin Lai**.

## Course Overview

The course consists of four laboratory sessions and a final project:

1. **Lab 1 & Lab 2**  
   These are straightforward examples that follow the tutorial provided in the corresponding [Lab 2 repository](https://github.com/bol-edu/course-lab_2).

2. **Lab 3**  
   This session uses the Xilinx Alveo U50 FPGA board to develop an application accelerator using OpenCL.

3. **Lab A & Lab B**  
   These sessions allow students to choose from a given set of options.  
   - **Lab A**: I chose to follow the Vitis HLS tutorial on dataflow optimization and deadlock debugging.

   - **Lab B**: I chose to implement a matrix multiplication accelerator.

## Final Project

For the final project, we formed a group to design and implement a complete system, including host software and a hardware kernel, for a Vision Transformer (ViT) accelerator.
